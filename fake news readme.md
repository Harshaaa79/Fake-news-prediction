Fake News Prediction

## Introduction

This project tackles the pressing issue of fake news detection by utilizing comprehensive data analysis and machine learning techniques. We conduct an in-depth review of the data distribution and visualize fake news labels through various plots and word clouds. Statements are preprocessed and analyzed to enhance the accuracy of label classification. The analysis also covers subjects, speakers, job titles, state details, party affiliations, and venues, employing strategic groupings to improve label differentiation. Additionally, numerical data features are explored through visualizations. Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, followed by a detailed comparison to identify the most effective approach. This notebook serves as a solid framework for predicting fake news, blending advanced data analysis with predictive modeling techniques.


## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.10 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
